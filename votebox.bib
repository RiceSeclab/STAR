	before" and "happened after" semantics for any event) without the
	need for a central timestamping authority or widespread storage of
	documents as in Haber and Stornetta 91. Their system relies only
	on an "authenticated broadcast" primitive.
	
	They do mention ({\S}3.1) the "Remember Everything" model, which they
	claim is too space-inefficient for any practical use (not so in our
	application, or really in any modern system). {\S}3.2 refines this
	by replacing entire documents with hashes; each participant simply
	remembers the current global authenticator. This requires a lot of
	cooperation in order to verify anything. The Benaloh/de Mare solution,
	{\S}3.3, is organized into "rounds": you must only store other documents
	if they were submitted in the same round as a document of yours.
	Everyone remembers the hash of every round. To verify your timestamp,
	you must submit all the documents (including yours!) that were posted
	that round; the hash of the set must match the round's hash. (This
	is identical to "everyone remembers everything" if you post documents
	frequently!)},

	by using a ballot box or voting booth to disassociate voters from
	ballots. Although such a system might achieve privacy, there is often
	little confidence in the accuracy of the announced tally. This thesis
	describes a practical scheme for conducting secret-ballot elections
	in which the outcome of an election is verifiable by all participants
	and even by non-participating observers. All communications are public,
	yet under a suitable number-theoretic assumption, the privacy of
	votes remains intact. The tools developed here to conduct such elections
	have additional independent applications. Cryptographic capsules
	allow a prover to convince verifiers that either statement A or statement
	B is true without revealing substantial information as to which.
	Secret sharing homomorphisms enable computation on shared (secret)
	data and give a method of distributing shares of a secret such that
	each shareholder can verify the validity of all shares.},

	remain anonymous to a second, while allowing the second to respond
	via an untraceable return address. The technique can also be used
	to form rosters of untraceable digital pseudonyms from selected applications.
	Applicants retain the exclusive ability to form digital signatures
	corresponding to their pseudonyms. Elections in which any interested
	party can verify that the ballots have been properly counted are
	possible if anonymously mailed ballots are signed with pseudonyms
	from a roster of registered voters. Another use allows an individual
	to correspond witha record-keeping organization under a unique pseudonym

  title = {Stones Unturned: Gaps in the Investigation of Sarasota's Disputed
	Congressional Election},
  author = {David L. Dill and Dan S. Wallach},
  month = apr,
  year = {2007},
  note = {\url{http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/sarasota07.html}},
  annote = {The November 2006 race for Florida's 13th Congressional District
	resulted in a 369 vote margin of victory for the winning candidate
	with more than 18,000 undervotes recorded on the ES\&S iVotronic
	touch-screen voting machines used in Sarasota County. Since then,
	the losing candidate and a coalition of local voters have filed suit
	against the state and local election officials (among other defendants),
	seeking a judicial order to rerun the election. A key question is
	whether a system malfunction may have induced the undervote rate.
	We evaluate the two major efforts previously undertaken by the State:
	a mock election, conducted by the State, and an analysis of the iVotronic
	source code, conducted by academic computer scientists under contract
	to the State. Press reports and summaries of the State's findings
	have created a public perception that the investigation was thorough
	and that the voting machines have been exonerated of contributing
	to the undervote. Based on our evaluation of the investigation, this
	perception is not justified. 
	
	There are many significant gaps in the tests conducted by Florida
	and its experts. The defined scope of the mock election specifically
	excluded examination of the vote selection process, which, based
	on voter complaints, should have been a major focus of the investigation.
	The tests were conducted in an artificial setting with the iVotronics
	mounted vertically, unlike their horizontal orientation in real elections.
	Furthermore, the State's report claims that there were no anomalies
	observed during the vote, yet video recordings of the test show occasional
	vote selections not registering on the machines. 
	
	The State's inspection of the iVotronic's software was also incomplete.
	The State's academic team read the source code but performed limited
	hands-on experimentation with demonstration machines. They made no
	attempt to examine whether the hardware functioned properly, nor
	did they examine iVotronic machines that were used in the actual
	election. The team performed no analysis based on compiling and executing
	the software, either on iVotronic hardware or in a ``test harness.''
	Such testing is commonly used to identify bugs that may manifest
	themselves only under obscure conditions. Likewise, the team did
	not review internal ES\&S documents, such as their bug tracking systems
	or software repositories, which might contain important clues about
	the problem. For key issues, including how the iVotronic screen is
	calibrated and how its smoothing filter operates, the final report
	contained insufficient detail to determine how these issues may have
	impacted the undervote. 
	
	In total, the State's investigations have provided no persuasive explanation
	for Sarasota's undervotes. We recommend additional testing and analysis
	of both the software and hardware used in Sarasota. We also recommend
	analysis of ES\&S's internal documents, including their bug tracking
	system and other versions (earlier and later) of their software.
	We estimate that this additional investigation could be conducted
	by an appropriate team of experts with about a month of work.

  abstract = {Voters are now demanding the ability to verify that their votes are
	cast and counted as intended. Most existing cryptographic election
	protocols do not treat the voter as a computationally-limited entity
	separate from the voting booth, and therefore do not ensure that
	the voting booth records the correct vote. David Chaum and Andrew
	Neff have proposed mixnet schemes that do provide this assurance,
	but little research has been done that combines voter verification
	with homomorphic encryp- tion. This thesis proposes adding voter
	verification to an existing multi-candidate election scheme (Baudron
	et al.) that uses Paillier encryption. A ``cut and choose'' protocol
	provides a probabilistic guarantee of correctness. The scheme is
	straightfor- ward, and could easily be extended to multi-authority
	elections. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is demonstrated
	via a simple implementation. },

	sources of vote totals -- VVPAT individual ballots, VVPAT summary,

	The current election system appears to provide some of its promised
	benefits at potentially great cost; namely, that the election system,
	in its entirety, exhibits shortcomings with extremely serious consequences,
	especially in the event of a close election. These shortcomings merit
	urgent attention. Relying on this system in its present state should
	be viewed as a calculated risk in which the outcome may be an acceptable
	election, but there is a heightened risk of unacceptable cost. The
	ESI team arrived at this conclusion only after completing the seven
	projects described above. This conclusion is supported not only by
	the findings themselves but also by the difficulty encountered in
	conducting the projects.},

  title = {{Logcrypt: Forward Security and Public Verification for Secure Audit
	Logs}},
  year = {2005},
  annote = {Holt points out that this idea has been discovered several times
	already [Bellare, Schneier]. From his introduction:
	
	"Logcrypt builds on the Schneier and Kelsey system, adding several
	significant improvements. The most significant is the ability to
	use public key cryptography with Logcrypt. Using the symmetric techniques
	just described, any entity who wishes to verify a log must possess
	the secret used to create the MACs. This secret gives the entity
	the ability to falsify log entries as well, which could be a ma jor
	drawback in many applications. Public key cryptography allows signatures
	to be created with one key and verified with a different one. Such
	signatures can be used in place of MACs to allow verification of
	a log without the ability to modify it, as well as allowing publication
	of the initial key used to create the log, since only the public
	key is needed for verification."
	
	Holt also introduces heartbeats, which he calls "metronome entries":
	
	"Logcrypt cannot prevent an attacker in control of a system from deleting
	and truncating files. But it can be used to let an administrator
	know when the log is no longer functioning normally by using metronome
	entries. Metronome entries are simply special log entries which are
	made at regular intervals to indicate that the log is still accepting
	new data. If an attacker truncates the log just before an incriminating
	entry was made, he also truncates any metronome entries entered after
	that entry, and must prevent any future entries from being recorded,
	since they will fail verification."},

  year = {2005},

  abstract = {Cryptographic voting protocols offer the promise of verifiable voting
	without needing to trust the integrity of any software in the system.
	However, these cryptographic protocols are only one part of a larger
	system composed of voting machines, software implementations, and
	election procedures, and we must analyze their security by considering
	the system in its entirety. In this paper, we analyze the security
	properties of two different cryptographic protocols, one proposed
	by Andrew Neff and another by David Chaum. We discovered several
	potential weaknesses in these voting protocols which only became
	apparent when considered in the context of an entire voting system.
	These weaknesses include: subliminal channels in the encrypted ballots,
	problems resulting from human unreliability in cryptographic protocols,
	and denial of service. These attacks could compromise election integrity,
	erode voter privacy, and enable vote coercion. Whether our attacks
	succeed or not will depend on how these ambiguities are resolved
	in a full implementation of a voting system, but we expect that a
	well designed implementation and deployment may be able to mitigate
	or even eliminate the impact of these weaknesses. However, these
	protocols must be analyzed in the context of a complete specification
	of the system and surrounding procedures before they are deployed
	in any large-scale public election. },

	privacy, auditability and verifiability. It can readily implement
	and carry out various voting procedures in parallel and can be used
	for small scale boardroom/department-wide voting as well as large
	scale elections. In addition, ADDER employs a flexible voting scheme
	which allows the system to carry out procedures such as surveys or

	to study cryptographic voting protocols from a systems perspective
	and to explore the security and usability of electronic voting systems.

  abstract = {With significant U.S. federal funds now available to replace outdated
	punch-card and mechanical voting systems, municipalities and states
	throughout the U.S. are adopting paperless electronic voting systems
	from a number of different vendors. We present a security analysis
	of the source code to one such machine used in a significant share
	of the market. Our analysis shows that this voting system is far
	below even the most minimal security standards applicable in other
	contexts. We identify several problems including unauthorized privilege
	escalation, incorrect use of cryptography, vulnerabilities to network
	threats, and poor software development processes. We show that voters,
	without any insider privileges, can cast unlimited votes without
	being detected by any mechanisms within the voting terminal software.
	Furthermore, we show that even the most serious of our outsider attacks
	could have been discovered and executed without access to the source
	code. In the face of such attacks, the usual worries about insider
	threats are not the only concerns; outsiders can do the damage. That
	said, we demonstrate that the insider threat is also quite considerable,
	showing that not only can an insider, such as a poll worker, modify
	the votes, but that insiders can also violate voter privacy and match
	votes with the voters who cast them. We conclude that this voting
	system is unsuitable for use in a general election. Any paperless
	electronic voting system might suffer similar flaws, despite any
	"certification" it could have otherwise received. We suggest that
	the best solutions are voting systems having a "voter-verifiable
	audit trail," where a computerized voting system might print a paper
	ballot that can be read and verified by the voter.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Over the last few years, our group has been working on applications
	of secure coprocessors---but has been frustrated by the limited computational
	environment and high expense of such devices. Over the last few years,
	the TCPA (now TCG) has produced a specification for a trusted platform
	module (TPM)---a small hardware addition intended to improve the
	overall security of a larger machine (and tied up with a still-murky
	vision of Windows-based trusted computing). Some commodity desktops
	now come up with these TPMs. Consequently, we began an experiment
	to see if (in the absence of a Non-Disclosure Agreement) we could
	use this hardware to transform a desktop Linux machine into a virtual
	secure coprocessor: more powerful but less secure than higher-end
	devices. This experiment has several purposes: to provide a new platform
	for secure coprocessor applications, to see how well the TCPA/TCG
	approach works, and (by working in open source) to provide a platform
	for the broader community to experiment with alternative architectures
	in the contentious area of trusted computing. This paper reports
	what we have learned so far: the approach is feasible, but effective
	deployment requires a more thorough look at OS security.},

	of vot- ers, so the data structure should be history-independent.
	Adversaries may try to surreptitiously add or delete votes from the
	storage unit after the election has concluded, so the storage should
	be tamper-evident. Finally, we must guard against an adversarial
	voting machine's attempts to mark ballots through the representation
	of the data structure, so we desire a subliminal-free representation.
	We leverage the properties of Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM),
	a special kind of write-once storage medium, to meet these requirements.
	We give constructions for data structures on PROM storage that simultaneously
	satisfy all our de- sired properties. Our techniques can significantly

	to give ``everlasting privacy'' for votes: even a computationally
	unbounded party does not gain any information about individual votes
	(other than what can be inferred from the final tally). Our voting
	protocols are designed to be used in a ``traditional'' setting, in
	which voters cast their ballots in a private polling booth (which
	we model as an untappable channel between the voter and the tallying
	authority). Following in the footsteps of Chaum and Neff, our protocol
	ensures that the integrity of an election cannot be compromised even
	if the computers running it are all corrupt (although ballot secrecy
	may be violated in this case). We give a generic voting protocol
	which we prove to be secure in the Universal Composability model,
	given that the underlying commitment is universally composable. We
	also propose a concrete implementation, based on the hardness of
	discrete log, that is slightly more efficient (and can be used in
	practice).},

	in which certificates are not revoked, but frequently issued for
	short-term periods is considered. Based on the authenticated search
	data structure scheme, a certificate update scheme is presented in
	which all certificates are updated by a common message. The suggested

	power of a corresponding input element, but the order of elements
	in the output is kept secret. Though it is a trivial matter for the
	"shuffler" (who chooses the permutation of the elements to be applied)
	to compute the output from the input, the construction is important
	because it provides a linear size proof of correctness for the output
	sequence (i.e. a proof that it is of the form claimed) that can be
	checked by an arbitrary verifiers. The complexity of the protocol
	improves on that of Furukawa-Sako[16] both measured by number of
	exponentiations and by overall size.The protocol is shown to be honest-verifier
	zeroknowledge in a special case, and is computational zeroknowledge
	in general. On the way to the final result, we also construct a generalization
	of the well known Chaum-Pedersen protocol for knowledge of discrete
	logarithm equality [10], [7]. In fact, the generalization specializes
	exactly to the Chaum-Pedersen protocol in the case k = 2. This result
	may be of interest on its own.An application to electronic voting
	is given that matches the features of the best current protocols
	with significant efficiency improvements. An alternative application
	to electronic voting is also given that introduces an entirely new
	paradigm for achieving Universally Verifiable elections.},

	be observed: 1) the ballot paper must be rectangular in shape and
	must bear in the upper half, in print if possible, the words Eligo
	in Summum Pontificem; on the lower half there must be a space left
	for writing the name of the person chosen; thus the ballot is made
	in such a way that it can be folded in two; 2) the completion of
	the ballot must be done in secret by each Cardinal elector, who will
	write down legibly, as far as possible in handwriting that cannot
	be identified as his, the name of the person he chooses, taking care
	not to write other names as well, since this would make the ballot
	null; he will then fold the ballot twice; 3) during the voting, the
	Cardinal electors are to remain alone in the Sistine Chapel; therefore,
	immediately after the distribution of the ballots and before the
	electors begin to write, the Secretary of the College of Cardinals,
	the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations and the Masters of Ceremonies
	must leave the Chapel. After they have left, the junior Cardinal
	Deacon shall close the door, opening and closing it again each time
	this is necessary, as for example when the Infirmarii go to collect
	the votes of the sick and when they return to the Chapel.
	
	66. The second phase, the scrutiny proper, comprises: 1) the placing
	of the ballots in the appropriate receptacle; 2) the mixing and counting
	of the ballots; 3) the opening of the votes. Each Cardinal elector,
	in order of precedence, having completed and folded his ballot, holds
	it up so that it can be seen and carries it to the altar, at which
	the Scrutineers stand and upon which there is placed a receptacle,
	covered by a plate, for receiving the ballots. Having reached the
	altar, the Cardinal elector says aloud the words of the following
	oath: I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge,
	that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be
	elected. He then places the ballot on the plate, with which he drops
	it into the receptacle. Having done this, he bows to the altar and
	returns to his place.
	
	If any of the Cardinal electors present in the Chapel is unable to
	go to the altar because of infirmity, the last of the Scrutineers
	goes to him. The infirm elector, having pronounced the above oath,
	hands the folded ballot to the Scrutineer, who carries it in full
	view to the altar and omitting the oath, places it on the plate,
	with which he drops it into the receptacle.
	
	67. If there are Cardinal electors who are sick and confined to their
	rooms, referred to in Nos. 41ff of this Constitution, the three Infirmarii
	go to them with a box which has an opening in the top through which
	a folded ballot can be inserted. Before giving the box to the Infirmarii,
	the Scrutineers open it publicly, so that the other electors can
	see that it is empty; they are then to lock it and place the key
	on the altar. The Infirmarii, taking the locked box and a sufficient
	number of ballot papers on a small tray, then go, duly accompanied,
	to the Domus Sanctae Marthae to each sick elector, who takes a ballot,
	writes his vote in secret, folds the ballot and, after taking the
	above- mentioned oath, puts it through the opening in the box. If
	any of the electors who are sick is unable to write, one of the three
	Infirmarii or another Cardinal elector chosen by the sick man, having
	taken an oath before the Infirmarii concerning the observance of
	secrecy, carries out the above procedure. The Infirmarii then take
	the box back into the Chapel, where it shall be opened by the Scrutineers
	after the Cardinals present have cast their votes. The Scrutineers
	then count the ballots in the box and, having ascertained that their
	number corresponds to the number of those who are sick, place them
	one by one on the plate and then drop them all together into the
	receptacle. In order not to prolong the voting process unduly, the
	Infirmarii may complete their own ballots and place them in the receptable
	immediately after the senior Cardinal, and then go to collect the
	votes of the sick in the manner indicated above while the other electors
	are casting their votes.
	
	68. After all the ballots of the Cardinal electors have been placed
	in the receptacle, the first Scrutineer shakes it several times in
	order to mix them, and immediately afterwards the last Scrutineer
	proceeds to count them, picking them out of the urn in full view
	and placing them in another empty receptacle previously prepared
	for this purpose. If the number of ballots does not correspond to
	the number of electors, the ballots must all be burned and a second
	vote taken at once; if however their number does correspond to the
	number of electors, the opening of the ballots then takes place in
	the following manner.

  abstract = {Secure logs are powerful tools for building systems that must resist
	forgery, prove temporal relationships, and stand up to forensic scrutiny.
	The proofs of order and integrity encoded in these tamper-evident
	chronological records, typically built using hash chaining, may be
	used by applications to enforce operating constraints or sound alarms
	at suspicious activity. However, the problem of how to automatically
	detect violations remains open. Low-level inconsistencies, such as
	gaps in the hash chain, are detectable without knowledge about the
	application, but existing research stops short of extracting or verifying
	application-specific log properties.
	
	In this paper we contribute the design and implementation of a system
	for discovering this kind of evidence. We first propose a logical
	language for applications to express concisely the constraints that
	apply to their logs and the evidence that can be extracted from them.
	We offer several algorithms for efficiently and incrementally evaluating
	these rules. Finally, we present Querifier, a log analysis package
	that implements our proposed techniques. It can be used offline as
	an analyzer for static logs, or online during the runtime of a logging
	application. Given validity rules and available log data, it presents
	evidence of correctness and offers counterexamples if desired. We
	describe Querifier's implementation and offer early performance results:
	for a rule set developed for a distributed voting application, we
	observed that our system could incrementally verify a realistic election-day
	log at 50 events per second.},

  abstract = {In elections employing electronic voting machines, we have observed
	that poor procedures, equipment failures, and honest mistakes pose
	a real threat to the accuracy of the final tally. The event logs
	kept by these machines can give auditors clues as to the causes of
	anomalies and inconsistencies; however, each voting machine is trusted
	to keep its own audit and ballot data, making the record unreliable.
	If a machine is damaged, accidentally erased, or otherwise compromised
	during the election, we have no way to detect tampering or loss of
	auditing records and cast votes. We see a need for voting systems
	in which event logs can serve as robust forensic documents, describing
	a provable timeline of events leading up to and transpiring on election
	day. 
	
	To this end, we propose an auditing infrastructure that draws on ideas
	from distributed systems and secure logging to provide a verifiable,
	global picture of critical election-day events, one which can survive
	individual machine malfunction or malice. Our system, the Auditorium,
	joins the voting machines in a polling place together in a private
	broadcast network in which all election events are logged redundantly
	by every machine. Each event is irrevocably tied to the originating
	machine by a digital signature, and to earlier events from other
	machines via hash chaining. 
	
	In this paper we describe in detail how to conduct an election in
	the Auditorium. We demonstrate our system's robustness to benign
	failures and malicious attacks, resulting in a believable audit trail

	CATS, a network storage service with strong accountability properties.
	A CATS server annotates read and write responses with evidence of

	enable clients to verify that the server is faithful. A faulty server
	cannot conceal its misbehavior, and evidence of misbehavior is independently
	verifiable by any participant. CATS clients are also accountable
	for their actions on the service. A client cannot deny its actions,
	and the server can prove the impact of those actions on the state
	views it presented to other clients. Experiments with a CATS prototype
	evaluate the cost of accountability under a range of conditions and
	expose the primary factors influencing the level of assurance and
	the performance of a strongly accountable storage server. The results
	show that strong accountability is practical for network storage
	systems in settings with strong identity andmodest degrees of write-sharing.
	The accountability concepts and techniques used in CATS generalize
	to a broader class of network services.},

	for dependable network systems. Conven- tional techniques for dependable
	systems design are insufficient to defend against an adversary that
	manipulates the system covertly in order to lie, cheat, or steal.
	This paper treats subversion as a form of fault, and suggests that
	de- signing accountability into the system provides the means to
	detect, isolate, and tolerate such faults, and even to pre- vent
	them by removing incentives for malicious behavior. A key challenge
	for the future is to extend the repertoire of de- pendable systems
	design and analysis with broadly applicable techniques to build systems
	with target levels of ac- countability quantified by the probability
	that an attacker will be exposed. },
  annote = {(sec.4)
	
	 How general are the techniques for accountable systems? 
	
	Any approach to accountability will impact the protocols and state
	representations for network services. General application-independent
	approaches are elusive. The major constraint to a general solution
	is the need to define component semantics to allow explicit verification;
	it must be possible to detect when a component's behavior violates
	its semantics, and tractable to prove that any audited action is
	a correct response to actions the component received, given its certified
	state. While this approach is feasible for particular classes of
	services and actions, applying these techniques to complex services
	will require significant effort and experimentation. A state-based
	solution can simplify the construction of accountable systems, as
	described in Section 3.2.

  annote = {Monotonic Counters Security applications and cryptographic protocols
	often make use of a special data value within the data or protocol
	to prevent a particular kind of attack called a ``replay attack''.
	In a simplistic example of such an attack we might consider a banking
	application that stores an account balance in encrypted form on a
	hard disk. Because of the encryption an attacker cannot arbitrarily
	change the account balance. In the replay attack, however, the attacker
	saves the encrypted balance at one point in time and then ``replaces''
	the current balance (still in encrypted form) with the saved encrypted
	balance. Without protection against this replay attack, the account
	balance would be reset to a prior value. To protect against this
	kind of attack, applications will generally add to the encrypted
	account balance an additional field containing the current value
	of a dedicated monotonic counter. When the encrypted balance is decrypted,
	the stored value of the monotonic counter is compared to the current
	value of the counter. If the values don't match, then the decrypted
	data is rejected. The dedicated monotonic counter is incremented
	when the account-balance changes, invalidating any stored encrypted
	version of the balance. It should be clear from this example that
	the monotonic counter must itself be protected. The v1.2 TPM provides
	a limited number of protected hardware monotonic counters for use
	by system software. Trusted software can provide a large number of
	dedicated ``virtual monotonic counters'' for applications based on
	a single hardware monotonic counter. The TPM's hardware monotonic
	counters are a scarce resource and the v1.2 TPM provides functions
	for managing these counters. The Monotonic counter function helps
	to prevent replay attacks against the TPM and increases the security
	of the system. The Monotonic counter function itself is neutral to
	TPM v1.2 Specification Changes October, 2003 platform Owner or user
	privacy. The increased security of the system may result in increased
	privacy protection by preventing attacks against TPM protocols that
	could lead to a disclosure of personal data. Tick Counter A number
	of applications exist for a secure time source within a PC. Providing
	such a time source in a TPM would significantly raise the cost of
	TPMs. As a compromise between cost and functionality, the v1.2 TPM
	Specification defines a Tick Counter that can, with some external
	support enable secure timing. By correlating the v1.2 TPM tick counter
	value with an external time-stamping source it becomes possible to
	use the TPM to do secure time stamping that uses an external time
	source, without the expense of adding a real-time clock to the TPM.
	The Tick Counter function is neutral to privacy and data protection.
