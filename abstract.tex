  The county clerk for a large municipality that has used DRE voting
  systems for a decade\footnote{The name of the municipality has been
    omitted to support the double-blind requirements of EVT/WOTE.} has
  decided that current voting systems on the market are unacceptable
  to replace their current systems as they reach the end of their
  expected service lifetime. A group of researchers were brought
  together to speak to the county elections staff, explore the
  available alternatives, and draft a specification that could be
  placed out for bidding. Our group included diverse experts with
  knowledge of cryptography, auditing, and usability. This paper
  describes the results of our joint effort: a DRE-style voting
  system, designed to support a variety of post-election audits, and
  including a paper trail and end-to-end cryptography, with a process
  that will be more usable than prior e2e systems.
