  In her 2011 EVT/WOTE keynote, Travis County, Texas County Clerk
  Dana Debeauvoir described the qualities she wanted in her ideal election system.
  Travis County had used DRE voting systems for a decade, and has
  decided that current voting systems on the market are unacceptable
  to replace their current systems as they reach the end of their
  expected service lifetime.
  In April of 2012, a group of researchers were invited to Austin, Texas
  and spent three days with   Debeauvoir and her staff exploring options and
  searching out alternatives.  
  Our group included diverse experts with
  knowledge of cryptography, auditing, and usability. This paper
  describes the results of our joint effort: a DRE-style voting
  system, designed to support a variety of post-election audits, and
  including a paper trail and end-to-end cryptography, with a process
  that will be more usable than prior e2e systems.
