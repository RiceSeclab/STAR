In her 2011 EVT/WOTE keynote, Travis County, Texas County Clerk
Dana DeBeauvoir described the qualities she wanted in her ideal election system
to replace their existing DREs.
In response, in April of 2012, the authors, working with DeBeauvoir and her staff,
jointly architected \projname, a voting system with a DRE-style human interface
and a ``belt and suspenders'' approach to verifiability.
It provides both a paper trail and end-to-end cryptography using COTS hardware.
It is designed to support both ballot-level risk-limiting audits,
and auditing by individual voters and observers.
The human interface and process flow is based on modern usability research.
This paper describes the \projname architecture, which could well be
the next-generation voting system for Travis County and perhaps
elsewhere.

{\em This paper is a working draft. Significant changes should be
  expected as the STAR-Vote effort matures.}
