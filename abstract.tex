\projname is a collaboration between a number of academics and
the Travis County (Austin), Texas elections office, which currently
uses a DRE voting system and previously used an optical scan voting system. 
\projname represents a rare opportunity for a variety of
sophisticated technologies, such as end-to-end cryptography and risk limiting
audits, to be designed into a new voting system, from scratch, with
a variety of real world constraints, such as election-day vote centers
that must support thousands of ballot styles and run
all day in the event of a power failure. This paper describes the
current design of \projname which is now largely settled and whose
development will soon begin.

  % expected as the STAR-Vote effort matures.}
