\projname is a collaboration between a number of academics and
the elections office of a large county that has previously used a DRE-style
voting system. \projname represents a rare opportunity for a variety of
sophisticated technologies, such as end-to-end cryptography and risk limiting
audits, to be designed into a new voting system, from scratch, with
a variety of real world constraints, such as election-day vote centers
that must support thousands of ballot styles and run
all day in the event of a power failure. This manuscript describes the
current design of \projname, whose design is largely settled and whose
development will soon begin.
